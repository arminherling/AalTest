# AalTest

## Description
Very basic test framework that I made for [Aalenian](https://github.com/arminherling/Aalenian), because QTest didn't support printing the combined results of multiple TestSuits without ugly hacks.

## Features
- Pretty console output
- Parameterized test
- Combined result of multiple test suits

## Downside
- Currently only supports windows
